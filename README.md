## Building via GitHub Actions (no local Maven needed)

This repo includes `.github/workflows/build.yml`, which builds the plugin
on GitHub's own servers every time you push. You never need Maven or a
JDK installed locally:

1. Create a new (empty) repository on GitHub.
2. Push this project to it:
   ```bash
   cd HeavensCollapse
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Heaven's Collapse plugin"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. On GitHub, open the **Actions** tab. A "Build HeavensCollapse" run
   starts automatically. Once it finishes (green check), click into the
   run and download the **HeavensCollapse** artifact under "Artifacts" -
   that zip contains the compiled `.jar`, ready to drop into `plugins/`.
4. Optional - get it as a proper GitHub Release instead of an artifact
   zip: tag a commit and push the tag, e.g.
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
   The workflow will attach `HeavensCollapse-1.0.0.jar` directly to a
   Release on the **Releases** page - a stable, permanent download link.

Any time you edit the code and push again, a fresh build (and artifact)
is produced automatically - no local build step at all.

## Building locally instead (optional)

If you'd rather build on your own machine: requires **JDK 21** and Maven.

```bash
cd HeavensCollapse
mvn clean package
```

The compiled plugin will be at:

```
target/HeavensCollapse-1.0.0.jar
```

## Installing

1. Stop your Paper 1.21.11 server.
2. Copy `HeavensCollapse-1.0.0.jar` into the server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Start the server. A default `config.yml` will be generated at
   `plugins/HeavensCollapse/config.yml`.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/heavenscollapse` | Gives yourself the Heaven's Collapse mace. |
| `/heavenscollapse <player>` | Gives the mace to another online player. Supports tab-completion of online player names. |

## Permissions

| Permission | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `heavenscollapse.give` | `op` | Required to run `/heavenscollapse`. |

## How the three-hit system works

- Each player has their **own independent hit counter** (tracked by UUID),
  stored in `AbilityManager`. Hitting with Heaven's Collapse as Player A
  never affects Player B's counter.
- The three hits **must land on the same target, back to back**. If your
  mace connects with a different entity than the one your streak was
  building against, the streak resets to 1 against that new target -
  hits on different victims never add up toward each other. Landing all
  `hits-required` hits on one target in a row is what "charges" the
  attempt.
- On the Nth hit, the counter **resets to 0 immediately**, whether or not
  the special attack actually goes off. The Nth hit is a *checked attempt*:
  - If the **wielder** is airborne → Heaven's Collapse triggers:
    guaranteed kill, lightning, sounds and particles.
  - If the **wielder** is standing on the ground → the attempt fizzles and
    the hit is treated as a completely normal mace hit. The next cycle of
    `hits-required` hits starts fresh.
- **Ground detection** primarily uses `Entity#isOnGround()`, Paper/
  Spigot's own server-side ground-collision flag, and also treats a
  player with a clearly non-zero vertical velocity as airborne even if
  that flag hasn't updated yet - `isOnGround()` can still read `true` for
  the first tick or two right as a player leaves the ground (e.g. the
  instant they jump), and without this fallback a charged hit landed at
  that exact moment would silently fizzle. **The check is on the wielder
  (the attacking player), not the target** - Heaven's Collapse activates
  only if the player themselves is airborne (jumping, falling, knocked
  back into the air, etc.) at the moment of the charged hit; if they're
  standing on solid ground, the attempt fizzles regardless of what the
  target is doing.
- **Idle reset:** if a player goes longer than `idle-reset-seconds`
  (default `30`) without landing a mace hit, their counter silently resets
  to 0 the next time they do hit something.
- **Switching away:** by default (`reset-on-item-switch: false`),
  switching your held hotbar slot away from Heaven's Collapse does
  **not** reset the streak - only the idle timeout above does. This
  matters for playstyles like mace-elytra combat, where you naturally
  touch other hotbar slots (equipping an elytra, grabbing rockets or a
  pearl) between swings without meaning to abandon your streak. Set
  `reset-on-item-switch: true` for the stricter behaviour where merely
  touching another slot resets the counter immediately.
- **Disconnects:** a player's counter is removed entirely when they leave
  the server, so no stale state accumulates over time.

## How the special attack guarantees a kill (and respects Totem of Undying)

The kill goes through Minecraft's **normal damage pipeline** instead of
bypassing it, specifically so Totem of Undying keeps working correctly.
`CombatListener` does two things on the triggering hit:

1. Caps the target's current health at **one heart** (`setHealth`,
   never healing them if they're already lower).
2. Sets that same hit's damage to **20 hearts** (`event.setDamage(40.0)`).

Even after armor, enchantment protection and resistance reduce that 40
damage, the remainder still vastly exceeds the one heart of health left,
so the kill is effectively guaranteed - but because it's still a genuine
`EntityDamageByEntityEvent` (not a direct health override), a totem in
the target's off-hand pops exactly as it would for any other lethal hit:
it cancels the death, consumes itself, and leaves the target at 1 HP with
the usual totem effects and sound.

- Armor, resistance, and absorption hearts do **not** prevent the kill
  (they reduce the 40 damage, but nowhere near enough to matter).
- Totem of Undying **is respected** - a target holding one survives, as
  it should.
- Death messages and kill credit still correctly attribute to the
  attacker, since this is an ordinary player-caused damage event.
- The ability **never triggers against the attacker themselves** and only
  ever targets `LivingEntity` instances.

## How the lightning-obtaining mechanic works

The original request describing this mechanic was ambiguous ("if a player
is holding the mace / is in the required 'mace' state when struck by
lightning"). The implemented interpretation:

> If a player is struck by lightning while holding a **plain, vanilla
> Mace** in either hand, that specific Mace transforms in place into
> Heaven's Collapse.

This is enabled/disabled via `lightning-obtain.enabled` in `config.yml`.
If `lightning-obtain.negate-damage` is `true` (default), the lightning
damage that triggered the transformation is cancelled, so the player
isn't punished for being "chosen."

**Duplication safety:** the mechanic *transforms* an existing plain Mace
rather than adding a new item. Once transformed, the item is no longer a
"plain Mace" (`HeavensCollapseItem#isPlainMace` returns `false` for it),
so even if the lightning event were somehow processed twice for the same
strike, the second pass finds nothing left to transform and does nothing.

If a player isn't holding a plain Mace when struck by lightning, nothing
special happens - lightning behaves completely normally.

## Configuration reference (`config.yml`)

```yaml
hits-required: 3          # Hits needed to trigger a charged attempt.
idle-reset-seconds: 30    # Seconds of inactivity before the counter resets.
reset-on-item-switch: false  # true = touching another hotbar slot also resets the streak.

lightning:
  enabled: true            # Master switch for the lightning visual/strike.
  damage: false            # true = a real lightning bolt (can hurt/ignite nearby blocks/entities).
                            # false = visual-only bolt (strikeLightningEffect), no damage or fire.
  fire: false               # Only used when damage: true - clears fire left near the strike.

effects:
  particles: true
  sounds: true

lightning-obtain:
  enabled: true
  negate-damage: true       # Cancel the lightning damage that grants the weapon.

messages:
  # ... color-coded ('&') message strings, see the shipped config.yml.
```

The plugin uses safe defaults for every value (`getInt`/`getBoolean` with
fallbacks), so a malformed or partially-edited `config.yml` will never
crash the plugin - missing or invalid keys just fall back to their
default.

## Known nuances

- Bukkit's `ArmorStand` technically implements `LivingEntity`, so a
  charged hit against an armor stand that is airborne (e.g. mid-fall)
  will trigger the special. This matches vanilla's own type hierarchy and
  is left as-is rather than special-cased.
- The item is marked unbreakable and uses a Paper-only visual enchant
  glint override (`ItemMeta#setEnchantmentGlintOverride`) instead of a
  real enchantment, so nothing about its appearance can interfere with
  damage calculation.
- Heaven's Collapse always comes with a **full max-level enchant set**
  baked in the moment it's created - via `/heavenscollapse` or by
  transforming a plain Mace with lightning: Density V, Wind Burst III,
  Fire Aspect II, Unbreaking III and Mending. Levels are read from each
  enchantment's own max level rather than hardcoded, so it stays "maxed
  out" automatically if a future update raises any of their caps. (The
  item is also flagged Unbreakable, which makes Unbreaking/Mending
  functionally redundant - they're included anyway so the tooltip shows
  the complete, unambiguous "maxed out" loadout.)
- **Anvil protection**: combining an enchanted book, repairing, or
  renaming Heaven's Collapse in an anvil is monitored by
  `AnvilProtectionListener`. If the anvil's result item ever comes out
  without the Heaven's Collapse identity (name/lore/glint/unbreakable/PDC
  tag) - which can happen if another plugin on the server rebuilds the
  result item as part of its own enchanting or attribute system - this
  listener re-stamps the identity onto the result while leaving whatever
  the anvil actually changed (new enchant, repaired durability, new name)
  intact. This covers the standard vanilla/Paper anvil case completely.
  If a server has a fully custom enchanting/attribute-swap GUI that
  bypasses the anvil inventory entirely (not a `PrepareAnvilEvent`), that
  plugin would need its own compatibility handling for custom items -
  outside what this plugin can control from the outside.

## Verifying the ability is working

With `debug.actionbar: true` (the default), the attacker sees a live
action-bar readout on every mace hit:

- `Heaven's Collapse: 1/3`, `2/3`, `3/3`
- On the 3rd hit: either **"HEAVEN'S COLLAPSE!"** (it fired) or
  **"Heaven's Collapse fizzled - you must be airborne to trigger it."**

That last message is the most common source of "it's not doing anything"
reports: **the special only checks on the Nth hit, and only fires if the
WIELDER is airborne at that exact moment** - jump, fall, or get knocked
into the air yourself right as you land the charged hit. The target's own
position doesn't matter. Once you've confirmed it works, set
`debug.actionbar: false` for normal play.

If you're seeing **no action-bar message at all**, work through this in
order:
1. `debug.actionbar: true` in `config.yml`? If it was turned off, you
   won't see the counter even though the ability is still working.
2. Are you hitting with the mace in your **main hand**?
3. Are the 3 hits landing on the **same target, back to back**? Hitting
   something else in between restarts the streak at 1 (see below).
4. If you see `HEAVEN'S COLLAPSE!` in the action bar but still no
   sounds/particles, check `effects.particles: true` and
   `effects.sounds: true` in `config.yml` - a client-side resource/texture
   pack that disables particles would also block them, but the action bar
   message tells you the ability itself fired regardless of what you can
   see or hear.
5. If none of the action-bar messages ever appear at all (not even the
   `1/3`, `2/3` counter on ordinary hits), the plugin likely isn't loaded
   - check `/plugins` in-game and the server startup log for "Heaven's
   Collapse has awakened."

## Cinematic effects

`EffectsUtil` plays the full "divine strike" presentation when Heaven's
Collapse activates (each layer independently toggleable via
`effects.sounds` / `effects.particles`):

- **Impact flourish** (at the target): a flash, END_ROD light rays,
  electric sparks, cloud burst, a dense Sculk Charge Pop burst, and a
  Sonic Boom particle (with its own built-in expanding-ring animation),
  plus a spark trail connecting the attacker to the target.
- **Sounds**: lightning thunder + impact, a heavy mace smash, a beacon
  chime, the Trident's Channeling thunder for a second storm rumble, and
  the Warden's sonic boom - all vanilla, so no resource pack is required.
- **Warden shockwave**: erupts from the **wielder**, not the victim - a
  genuinely spherical burst (directions distributed with a Fibonacci
  sphere, so it expands as an even globe rather than a flat ring or
  clustering at the poles) of 48 points, alternating between Sculk Soul
  wisps and Sculk Charge Pop motes, growing out to an 8-block radius over
  14 ticks (~0.7s). Three echoing Sonic Boom pulses follow it at
  staggered delays for a "rolling thunder" that extends how long the
  whole effect reads. All of it is implemented as repeating/delayed
  tasks rather than single spawns, so the particles visibly travel
  outward instead of just appearing already spread out.

## Troubleshooting

**`mvn clean package` fails to resolve `io.papermc.paper:paper-api`**
Make sure you have an internet connection and that
`https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/` isn't blocked by a
firewall/proxy. This repository is declared in `pom.xml` and is required
to download the Paper API.

**Compilation errors about `release 21`**
You need JDK 21 specifically (`java -version`). Paper 1.21.x requires
Java 21; older JDKs will fail to compile or run the plugin.

**Plugin loads but `/heavenscollapse` says "Unknown command"**
Check the server log on startup for a warning from HeavensCollapse about
failing to register the command - this almost always means `plugin.yml`
wasn't packaged correctly. Verify `plugin.yml` is present in the built jar
under its root (unzip the jar and check).

**The special attack never triggers**
- Confirm you're hitting with the mace in your **main hand** specifically.
- Confirm **you (the wielder)** are actually airborne at the moment of the
  charged hit - jump and swing mid-air, or hit while falling. The
  target's position doesn't matter, only yours. A wielder standing on
  even a thin block, slab, or fence post still counts as "on the ground."
- Confirm `hits-required` in the config matches what you expect, and that
  you haven't gone idle past `idle-reset-seconds` between hits (switching
  hotbar slots no longer resets it by default - see
  `reset-on-item-switch`).
- Turn on `debug.actionbar: true` and watch the action bar - it tells you
  exactly whether each hit is being counted and why the Nth hit did or
  didn't fire.

**Real lightning damages/burns things I didn't want it to**
Set `lightning.damage: false` (the default) to use the purely visual
`strikeLightningEffect` instead of a real lightning bolt.

**Getting duplicate items from the lightning-obtain mechanic**
This shouldn't happen given the transform-in-place design described
above; if you suspect another plugin is also listening to
`EntityDamageEvent` with cause `LIGHTNING` and interacting with the same
item, please report the exact reproduction steps.
